# kvarto-files

Kvarto is a 1 vs 1 game app where players compete to place four pieces in a row on a 4x4 board to win. Pieces can be different shapes, colors, and heights, but a winning four-in-a-row only needs a single attribute in common. But there’s a twist: you pick your opponent’s piece! Kvarto includes user authentication, chat, statistics, and more. Firebase’s Realtime Database is used to keep the game interactive, along with Firebase Functions for cloud management and notifications.
